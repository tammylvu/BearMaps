# BearMaps
Created a web mapping application that allows that finds the most optimal route given two points on a visualization.  Similar/inspired by Google Maps. 
I created the web server that listens for requests and handles them.

I created the back end for this project by implementing:
- quad trees to rasterize the image according to level of zoom
- A\* algorithm to create the optimal route from one location to the next

What it looks like:

The rest was implemented by Alan Yao.
